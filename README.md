# Graph View

## Description
GraphView is a very simple graph library for both iOS and OS X that lets you very easily plot a graph from real-time data. We use it internally at MOON Wearables to plot real-time data from different sensors. Below you can see a screenshot and some GIFs of the graph view plotting sample data generated by compound sine waves. There's example code for both OS X and iOS in their respective folders.

## API
### Overview
The entire library is just one class called `GraphView`. It has a range of properties that can be used to customize the graph, and a few methods to add and remove data. The graph automatically scales based on the values you've passed into it. Although you can force it to not scale by setting `isAutoscaling = false` and `visibleRange = 3...5`, or whatever range you want. On iOS, you can also pinch and pan on the graph to move around. If you don't want this behavior (like if you're using it in a table view) you can set `gesturesEnabled = false`.

### Properties



##### var backgroundTint = BackgroundTintColor.blue
This will set the background gradient of the graph. It's an enum with eight colors to pick from: `.gray`, `.red`, `.green`, `.blue`, `.turquoise`, `.yellow`, `.purple`, and `.clear`. The default is `.blue`.

##### var sampleColor = SampleColor.color(plain: .white)

##### var roundedCorners = false
Use this to make the corners rounded or square. The default is true, meaning rounded corners.

##### var title: String = ""
Used to set the title of the graph in one of the upper corners. The default value for this is `""`, meaning that it will not be displayed.

##### var subtitle: String = ""
Used to set a subtitle that will go right underneath the title. The default value for this is `""`, and will thus not be displayed.

##### var valueUnit: String = ""

##### var valueUnitDecimals = 0

##### var capacity = 1000
This sets how many samples will fit within the view. E.g., if you set this to 200, what you will see in the view is the last 200 samples. You can't set it to any lower than 2. The default value of this is 150.

##### var graphType = GraphType.scatter
Changes how the samples are drawn. The current options are `.line` and `.scatter`. The default is `.scatter`.

##### var sampleSize = SampleSize.small

##### var gesturesEnabled = true

##### var visibleRange: ClosedRange<Float> = 0...1

##### var isAutoscaling = true

##### var horizontalLines: [Float] = []





### Methods
##### func add(sample: Float)
This method is where you add your data to the graph.

##### func replace(with: [Float])

##### func clear()
Removes all the samples you've added to the graph. All the other properties like `roundedCorners` and `capacity` etc are kept the same. Useful if you want to reuse the same graph view.

## Todo
- Change the size of the labels when the view gets too small.
- I'm pretty sure there's a different way of doing this that will make it faster. Will probably end up drawing into a bunch of tall, skinny CALayers, and then moving them sideways.
- <del>Have an auto-scale feature. Might do this by having an Optional scale tuple with a min and max value. If this is nil, use auto-scale. If it's set use a fixed scale.</del>
- <del>Add IBDesignable</del>
- <del>Add scatter plot</del>
